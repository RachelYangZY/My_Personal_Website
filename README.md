# My_Personal_Website

The purpose of this project was to learn front-end coding using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also helps document my various endeavors and experiences. While the website is currently still incomplete and does not contain the full functionality I have envisioned for it, it provides a baseline for what I could accomplish in a couple hours. 
Next steps: integrate responsive web design, refactor, learn and integrate web development frameworks (ex. bootstrap), try scroll animation and parallax scrolling, add visuals for each project and a link to the project/project code, enhance visual appeal of website
