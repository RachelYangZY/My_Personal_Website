# My_Personal_Website

The purpose of this project was to learn front-end coding using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also helps document my various endeavors and experiences. While the website is currently still incomplete and does not contain the full functionality I have envisioned for it, it provides a baseline for what I could accomplish in a couple hours. 

**To use:** I didn't want to register a domain for my personal website just yet, so my apologies! You'll have to do a few extra steps to access the website. It's as simple as downloading and running the html file on your local computer. I used Visual Studio Code, but there are many other ways. Make sure the image is in the same folder to ensure it shows up properly!

**Next steps:** integrate responsive web design, refactor, learn and integrate web development frameworks (ex. bootstrap), try scroll animation and parallax scrolling, add visuals for each project and a link to the project/project code, enhance visual appeal of website
